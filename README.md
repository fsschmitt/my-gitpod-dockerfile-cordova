Testing the difference between gitpod Dockerfiles and .gitpod.yml files



You can build any github repository by inserting

gitpod.io/# 

infront of the url (I have done it inside the url after the https::// so that it works as a link)

https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-android



Try this Android Cordova build latest snapshot

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#snapshot/17f123af-ed64-4d5c-948a-69b7eee86014)


In the terminal type

./a01-create.sh  

Enter your app name.

to create an Android app from a web page

Then edit the www index.html file save using ctrl-S and then type

./a02-re-build.sh


to rebuild the app. Now refresh your browser and use the qr code to load it on your phone.
(May have to change app security to allow installation using chrome or your qrcode reader browser)


Good luck
